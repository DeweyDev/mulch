#Mulch

A Chemistry Stoichiometry C++ Library

[x] Parses Chemical Equations
[ ] Balances Chemical Equations
[ ] Does g/mol conversions, etc

This project is currently in development phase, and there are no stable releases available.

##Current Plan

Currently there are three repos of Mulch. This is the main repository, and there are two personal repos over @shrimpboyho and @dpwivagg 

There repositories are focused on two seperate aspects of this project.

@shrimpboyho is strictly for parser development

@dpwivagg is strictly for calculator development

Once both parts of the project work, one C++ class will be created and it will be known as the ChemEquation.

##Jobs

There are many jobs availible for those who want to contribute to the growth of this project.

We are currently in need of someone to maintain documentation, as well as someone who is experienced will managing pull requests.

There are future plans to port this library over to JavaScript utilizing Emscripten.

##How To Build

Build at your own risk.

Build using the Code::Blocks IDE. There is a project file in the repository one can open.
